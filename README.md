First one:1 Too Long
The number: n = 6, 332, 659, 870, 762, 850, 625 is long - 19 characters long (omitting
commas). This is too long. Using the symbols: +, −, ∗, ÷,(,), ∧ (for exponentiation, as
in 2 ∧ 3 = 8), !(factorial), and the usual numbers 0 − 9, write n in as few symbols as
possible.
You may make multiple submissions, and you do not need a proof that your expression
is minimal.
2 Examples
1. We can write 120 in 2 symbols as 5!.
2. We can write 43, 046, 721 as 3 ∧ 16, which uses 4 symbols, but a better representation
would be 9 ∧ 8, which uses 3.
3. 7, 122, 217, 027 = 1924 ∧ 3 + 3, which uses 8 symbols. Parenthesis are omitted due
to the usual assumed order of operations.


Here is my goal: try to find a solution that can always find the shortest symbols to representation such a long number.
